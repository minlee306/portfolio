                <p>For my book cover, I chose to find key visual elements in the Lord of the Rings. It is not only famous in terms of the novel but also as movies too. I really enjoyed both. It is a fantasy adventure genre that involves hobbits, magic, elves, and many more. It talks about friendship, love, and evil force against the good. The golden rings symbolize fighting for power and glory. A group of men goes on a quest to destroy the ring and defeat the evil force. One of the main characters is called Frodo Baggins who is a hobbit and I wanted to design a book cover that is the 1st episode of the book series and the movie series. I went for the simple approach in finding images from Unsplash.com and typed lord of the rings. And there I found several images of the hobbit houses. As the primary visual I selected the entrance door of a hobbit house.
                
                As I wanted to add more images to this background, I made sure the appearance is shown a little dim using the opacity function in GIMP. I selected another image that shows golden rings in a red background. I changed the opacity for this image too. Also, I changed the scale and used the sheer tool for the ring image so that it can be more visual on the top of the book cover. Then I added another layer for the text to be added that shows “The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien” using the bold Vladimir Script as the font type. I changed the font size and dragged the images around so they will all align together as I want them to be. I tried going through the toolbox and see if there were any more functions I can use. While using GIMP, I realized that you can go in so many directions. I was able to convert my project to a jpeg image file and see my result.</p>

            <p>For my logo, I wanted to reflect on my passion for yoga as it is one of my favorite hobbies. I wanted to make it simple yet elegant to represent calmness and meditation. So, I decided to choose the shape of the circle as I want it to represent consistency. Practicing and being consistent in yoga will bring great results to your health. I chose the star image because I have experience doing yoga under the stars on campus. It was a memorable experience for me so I inserted this shape into the circle. I used the select object and nodes function a lot while using Inkscape. I tried other shapes too but I decided to stick with the circle and star. Inside the star, I decided to write the word Namaste as it is a respectful greeting term in the yoga community. I used the Abril as the font type. I chose the color three of my favorite colors light pink, dark pink, and purple, and color-coordinated in my personal yoga studio logo. I had to make the text, the star image, and the circle image to be grouped by using the group function. It was very important to remember that otherwise all of my items would have been all over the place. I had to re-do this project from the beginning because I kept forgetting that step. I added another shape as the concept was doing yoga under the stars. I wanted to add the moon shape but in order to do that, I made two circles, one black and one white which is the same as the background color. I grouped them together to make a moon shape through overlapping and it worked! So I placed it on the right side corner and used the ‘select and transform the object’ tool and tilted it towards the left so that it can align with the circle. I had to watch a lot of tutorials on Youtube to get an idea of which button I have click on and which function I should be used in certain contexts. I had to go through many trials and errors that took hours for me. In the end, I learned so much and there are so many features here and I would like to explore more!</p>
