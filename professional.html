                <div><p>I’ve never used Adobe Animate so this project was very challenging for me. The reason why it was a difficult project is because of the navigation and function of the Adobe Animate software. As my familiarity level was low and because I had to learn several functions within the software, it was time-consuming while requiring a lot of mental effort. Learning a new technical software is something that I need to get used to especially as an instructional designer and future online educator. However, after going over several YouTube tutorials and Adobe Animate tutorials for long hours, I was a little comfortable with this tool. I wanted to create a short and concise explanation about a bouncing ball which I thought was an interesting animation to make. So, I followed the tutorials to create an animation regarding a topic about kinetic energy.</p></div>
                
            
                <div><p> I used Voice memos on my MacBook and converted them into an MP3 file to combine it with my Adobe Animate video. I used the trimming function to make sure there were no dead sounds in my audio.</p></div>

<div><p>The background color is light pink, and the moving ball object was in red-orange. In one layer, I made several keyframes to showcase the movement of the moving ball. When the ball hits the ground, I reshaped the circle and used the squeeze and stretch method. I used the text tool to insert the word, kinetic energy, and I drew a black-colored arrow to indicate when the red circle hits the bottom of the screen. For the fade-out transition effect, I incorporated a motion tween in another layer using a blank light pink background that will cover the entire screen and vector images, the basketball, and the volleyball. I had to make sure to align all the keyframes in the layer section. For this reason, in my project I had to make a total of 6 layers for each element: Fading background, volleyball image, basketball image, arrow, text, and the bouncing ball. After I replayed it several times in the preview section, I decided to convert my project from an SWF file to an MP4 file using Adobe Media Encoder. I used iMovie to compile my narration and animation. After this step, I was able to successfully upload it on YouTube. I am planning to use this tool more often for self-projects because I would like to continuously build my graphic design skills and also visual effect design skills. There are a varitey of tools that I am learning in terms of multimedia production and I am glad that I was able to spend time to know more about Adobe Animate. </p></div>
