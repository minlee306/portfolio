As I am a Kombucha lover, I decided to make a video about the first fermentation process of the overall kombucha making. I was slightly familiar with making videos but not necessarily with Camtasia, so I wanted to try this software out. This video is targeted to anyone who is interested in making beverages inside their home.</p></div>
                

<div><p>I used a lot of images from Unsplash.com and other website sources to find high-quality sill images for this video project. I had to pour in some time to find relevant photos that will go well with my narration so overall this stage was time-consuming. In the introduction, I started with using transition effects with blinds and the dissolve effect before entering the main content. After that, I used an animation effect on my screen for the next clip using the full opacity effect that makes the screen turn dark to light. For screen captions, I used annotations using the callout and line functions to indicate a direction on the screen as a video effect. For integrating screen captions, my PowerPoint slides already had text embedded as screen text for the viewers. So, I was able to fulfill this requirement. I also added the fade effect when it was presented. In two of the slides, I used the scale-up function which is one of the animation effects that is similar to the Ken Burns zooming effect. There were several transition effects including the whip spin, wheel and circle reveal option in Camtasia that were fun to integrate into this project for me.</p></div>

<div><p>For audio editing, I used the trimming effect to make sure that there were no dead sounds in between my narration. It was convenient in Camtasia because I was able to see the volume level visually. I was able to insert the fade-in and fade-out function at the beginning and at the end of the video. I added noise removal to all of my audio clips as well.

For integrating my background music and narration, since the process of making Kombucha making needs focus and patience, I used a slow jazz piano music in the background. My narration will be louder than the background majority of the time. I made sure the background music is loud in the beginning and in the end using transition fading effects in Camtasia. I used Microsoft Word to write down my narration piece for each slide to put in the Microsoft PowerPoint slide. I had to go through several takes to embed my voice in each slide to make sure that my voice is not breaking or there are unnecessary noises in between.</p></div> 
    
    <div><p>After I converted my PowerPoint slides with voiceovers into an MP4 file, I imported it to Camtasia. I was able to separate the audio and video file and then I deleted the video portion because I only needed the audio file. I already had the slides as images in my media file in Camtasia. I did not need any duplicates. In Camtasia, I was able to use the noise filter functions to smooth my overall voice recording which was held in my living room. Below I included all of my sources for this project and in the video, I included the credits slide in the end. Also, I made sure the references are listed in the description box in my YouTube video. This was a great experience for me as I am very interested in videography in general. I would like to perform more video projects in the future using more of a variety of video effects!</p></div>
