                    Quiz:</b>

I had little experience in HTML, however, creating a quiz was foreign to me. I followed every step using Dr. L’s tutorial for this assignment. My quiz was about plants as I have started to get some interest in planting, however, due to my lack of knowledge, I wanted to present a basic quick about plants. I used the program Text Edit first as I copy and pasted the original HTML codes for the quiz. However, I switched to using Brackets as it looked more organized to me in terms of having the lines and columns which was easy for me to locate and navigate words and code elements. I think from now on I will continuously be using Brackets for coding.

                    I started by changing the title, and all of the questions. I added 5 additional questions for this assignment changing the JavaScript coding.</p></div>
                

<div><p><b>Quiz Look and Feel:</b>

Since I am presenting my quiz about plants, I wanted to choose a background image of green plants at the top of the page. So, I searched for tree images in Unsplash. It took me a couple of hours to figure out how I can change the image alignment to the center. After much research, I finally found how I can center my image at the top of my page. I played around with several codes including "div" and "center" and added the image source and adjusted the width and height of the image.

I also changed the background color using the HTML color picker as a reference and copy and pasted the HEX code. For some spacing and division purposes, I used "br" and "hr" coding to add space and add a horizontal line on my page. Overall, I changed the font size and font type by editing the HTML codes which was straightforward to me. I enjoyed seeing the changes that I made as I constantly saved and refreshed my index.html page while editing. Using HTML and JavaScript coding, I realized that you have to be very detail-oriented because one letter mistake can lead to crashing your page which was very interesting to me.</p></div>

<div><p><b>Webhosting:</b>

I chose GoDaddy as my Webhosting tool with the option for 12 months, the Economy with Cpanel, and created my own domain which is minyounglee.org. The web tutorial in terms of creating my account was very helpful overall. I had no issues using the cPanel and uploading my files. I tested my links and quiz elements before launching and I am satisfied with my results. After going through the process of making this quiz, I am more comfortable playing around with HTML and Javascript. </p></div>

<d><p>I used Brackets for this specific assignment for CSS and HTML coding. As soon as I changed the original drag.html file from this assignment to an index.html file, I opened the drag zip files to Brackets and started watching web-based tutorials to get familiar with creating this project.</p></d>

<d><p><b>JavaScript changes that I made:</b>

To stop the shuffling effect in the Concepts/Names section, I changed the coding of shuffle items from true to false, so it no longer shuffles the items whenever I refresh the page. Also, I changed the coding of the ‘locked after drag’ item, where I wanted the participants to have only 1 attempt to drag the concepts.</p></d>

<d><p><b>HTML changes that I made:</b>

I changed the title to plant types as that is my topic of interest. I also changed the 1 sentence description in the coding. I changed all the items within the context to fit my topic. I added one more categorical box for the participants to drag items. There are a total of 4 boxes and 12 items to drag in the final version. I copy and pasted the coding items to add the elements.</p></d>

<d><p><b>CSS changes that I made:</b>

I open style.css in Brackets and I went to the body section and changed the font-family to Verdana and background color. I googled CSS color picker and chose #7da832 as my background. But I changed my mind and then I added a forest image as my background instead. The main content box was aligned towards the left so I changed the margin to auto to center it in my CSS coding. The font color was changed to white and I made sure the alignment was centered as well. I tried to not delete the ; (semicolon) to make sure my code does not get messed up. Also, I changed the label box colors to #a84632. Through Bracket, it was easy for me to locate all items to change because it had grey notes descriptions next to the elements which are different from using KompoZer. After this step, I wanted to make sure that all the label boxes were in one line, so I changed the border sizes overall including width and height by changing the numbers of the px. This applies to the overall borderlines and for each box element. It was important to continuously save as soon as I make changes and I enjoyed this whole process of creating this assessment activity!</p></d>   
                
                <d><p>This activity was helpful to start from an original file that was already provided for this assignment. There were several changes that were made, however, now as I went through the whole process, I will be able to develop and design my own website and web-based activities from scratch even though it will require more time and effort.</p></d>
