<div><p>I chose the topic of “How to use Stickies in your MacBook” because I thought it would be helpful to my audience who wants to stay on track with their projects or to-do lists. They can use this program to write down everything they have to accomplish without forgetting any tasks because it will be displayed on their desktop. The video length is a total of 2 min 52 seconds. When it comes to demonstration clips, I realized that it can be effective for the videos to be be concise, short and simple considering their attention span. </p></div> 

<div><p>I used several functions and animations for this project. First, I added some text and annotations for the title screen and applied the pop-up behavior function. I used the highlighted mouse so my audience will know where they should be looking while I navigate through the software program. I used the radial blur function for transition in between. I also used the Smart Focus function for zooming in and transitioning. I also used the fade-out transition at the end of the video. I made sure I removed noise in my audio. I enjoyed using Camtasia as I was able to work on video editing and audio editing, both at the same time. This will be one of the tools that I will continuously be using for creating educational media!</p></div>
