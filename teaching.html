                <div><p>I watched the Camtasia tutorials from TechSmith which were very straightforward and easy to understand. There were several video clips for me to watch and learn how to use Camtasia and it was helpful for me to refresh my memory in using this program. The functions in Camtasia are straightforward and easy to apply and I spent majority of this project going through options on what meets my best interest in creating this recorded screencast video. I enjoyed playing around within this software tool. </p></div>

<div><p>I chose the topic of “How to use Stickies in your MacBook” because I thought it would be helpful to my audience who wants to stay on track with their projects or to-do lists. They can use this program to write down everything they have to accomplish without forgetting any tasks because it will be displayed on their desktop. The video length is a total of 2 min 52 seconds. When it comes to demonstration clips, I realized that it can be effective for the videos to be be concise, short and simple considering their attention span. </p></div> 

<div><p>I used several functions and animations for this project. First, I added some text and annotations for the title screen and applied the pop-up behavior function. I used the highlighted mouse so my audience will know where they should be looking while I navigate through the software program. I used the radial blur function for transition in between. I also used the Smart Focus function for zooming in and transitioning. I also used the fade-out transition at the end of the video. I made sure I removed noise in my audio. I enjoyed using Camtasia as I was able to work on video editing and audio editing, both at the same time. This will be one of the tools that I will continuously be using for creating educational media!</p></div>
